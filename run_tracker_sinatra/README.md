## Description
Hello!

Welcome to the second project for Flatiron's Software Engineering bootcamp!

This will be utilizing the Sinatra gem to track a user's runs.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project!

## Install Instructions
Clone the repository with the following git link: git@github.com:leah-hirschfeld/run_tracker_sinatra.git

Or the following command: git clone git@github.com:leah-hirschfeld/run_tracker_sinatra.git

## Usage
Spin up the website using the Shotgun gem which is a reloading rack development server. A user signs up at '/signup'. This page will require a username and password. It will then direct the user to the list of runs ('/runs'). Users can add their runs to the larger list. The user can browse other user's runs but only edit their own runs. The user can then log out and log in at any time at '/login'.
